when an object is of a type of derived class, it can be implicitly converted from derived to base class. When assigning an object of a derived type to 
base type, it can have a different type for its static and dynamic type 

class Base {
}; 

class Derived : public Base{
}; 

Derived b; 
Derived bp = new Derived; 

Base* a1 = &b; 
Base& a2 = bp; 

Derived* bp = & b; 
Base* a3 = bp; 

a1, a2, and a3 have different static and dynamic types
