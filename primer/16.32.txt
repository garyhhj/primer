When a template function is called or instantiated, the compiler tries to deduce a correct set of types for the template 
parameters. THe compiler will do two type conversions for this, const conversion and array to pointer converion. It may remove 
consts for non ref types since its not modifying the copy and arrays will be converted to pointer types. If there 
are no suitable type conversions, you will get a compiler error.
