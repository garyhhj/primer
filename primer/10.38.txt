Input iterator: 
	==, != equality and inequailty to compare iterators 
	++ prefix and postfix increment to advance iterators
	* dereference to read elements (appear on rhs assignment)
	-> arrow operator to fetch members 

Output Iterator: 
	++ prefix and postfix increment to advance iterators 
	* dereference to write elemnets (appear on lhs of assignment)

Forward Iterator: 
	everything in Input iterator and Output iterator 

Bidirectional Iterator: 
	everything in Input iterator and Output iterator
	-- prefix and postfix decrement to decrement iterator 

Random-access Iterator: 
	everything in Input iterator and Output iterator 
	-- prefix and postfix decrement to decrement iterator 
	<, <=, >, >= relational operators (to compare relative position of two iterators)
	+, +=, -, -= addition and subtraction operators (for iterators and integral values)
	- subtraction operator (difference between two iterators)
	iter[n] subscript iterator (also same as *(iter + n))
