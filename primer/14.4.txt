rules
=, [], (), -> must be class members 
+= and -= usually class members 
operators that change state of object should be class members &, --, ++ 
+, -, etc should be non class members


a) %, non class members 
b) &=, compound operator so should be class members
c) ++, changes state of object so shoudl be class members 
d) ->, must be class members 
e) <<, non class members 
f) &&, non class members
g) ==, class members (non member? but then comparing between two different T objects... I guess it makes sense)
h) (), must be class members
