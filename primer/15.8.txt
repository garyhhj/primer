a static type is the type that is used when declaring a variable 

ex. 
SalesData a //static type of SalesData

a dynamic type is the type that an object is dynamically bound to and is determined during runtime 

ex. 
class BookSalesData : public SalesData{
	//some code for the class 
}; 

BookSalesData a; 
SalesData* b = &a; //b has a dynamic type of BookSalesData*
