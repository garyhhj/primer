copy constructor is a constructor that takes a reference of the same object type as argument (with the rest of the arguments being default arguments or no argument)

it is invoked when there is invoked when 
- = assignment is used to construct an object 
- function is called with parameter being nonreference values 
- function is returning parameter with nonreference values 
- brace initialization of arrays or aggregate class 

a compiler may choose to use direct initialization to construct an object in place of copy initialization when copy initialization is normally called
