(a) A class must provide at least one constructor.
yes, if programmer does not provide one, the class will create a synthesized default constructor 


(b) A default constructor is a constructor with an empty parameter list.
false, it is that or a constructor with all arguments having a default value 


(c) If there are no meaningful default values for a class, the class should not
provide a default constructor.
yes, it prevents users of the class from muddling with unmeaningful values

(d) If a class does not define a default constructor, the compiler generates
one that initializes each data member to the default value of its associated
type
false, it initializes with in-class initialization first and then default initialization
