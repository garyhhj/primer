all keys in the map must support arithmetic operator "<". 

std::vector<int>::iterator support "<" arithmetic operator so we can define std::map<std::vector<int>::iterator, int> 
std::list<int>::iterator does not support "<" arithmetic operator so we can not define std::map<std::list<int>::iterator,int>
